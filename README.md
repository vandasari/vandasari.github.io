# About Me
I have a PhD in Mathematics with research background in cancer modeling and years of postdoctoral experience in this research area. My tasks involved developing and analyzing mathematical models/equations for cancer cell growth and migration, also wound healing. In 2019, I thought I would try learning Python programming seriously. It led me to machine learning, deep learning, dynamic programming, and Bayesian filtering, which all have become tools that I use in my research now.
